## Data set Description ##

The Human Activity Recognition data set was generated as a result of an experiment involving 30 participants (labelled in the data set as *Subjects*, each performing the following 6 activities:
1. Walking
2. Walking Upstairs
3. Walking Downstairs
4. Sitting
5. Standing
6. Laying

As the participants performed the aforementioned activities, a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) tied to the waist of each participant recorded sensor signals for various metrics, using its embedded [Accelerometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) and [Gyroscope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope). An accelerometer is an inertial sensor that measures acceleration by making use of an Inertial or Fictitious force; A gyroscope is a mechanical device that measures orientation and angular velocity, using Earth's gravity. 
When combined, accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used for a more accurate recognition of movement). Accelerometers and gyroscopes can take measurements over 3 axes, X, Y, and Z; in the current data set, measurements have indeed been taken over these 3 axes.
