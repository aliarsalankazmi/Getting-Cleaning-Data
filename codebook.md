## Data set Description ##

The Human Activity Recognition data set was generated as a result of an experiment involving 30 participants (labelled in the data set as *Subjects*), each performing the following 6 activities:
- Walking
- Walking Upstairs
- Walking Downstairs
- Sitting
- Standing
- Laying

As the participants performed the aforementioned activities, a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) tied to the waist of each participant recorded sensor signals for various metrics, using its embedded [Accelerometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) and [Gyroscope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope). An accelerometer is an inertial sensor that measures acceleration by making use of an Inertial or Fictitious force; A gyroscope is a mechanical device that measures orientation and angular velocity, using Earth's gravity. When combined, accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used for a full 6 Degree of Freedom motion tracking system. Also, accelerometers and gyroscopes can take measurements over 1, 2, or 3 axes, depending upon requirements. 
In the current data set, such measurements have been recorded over 3 axes, and in total, the data set contains 88 variables/columns over 180 records (30 Subjects performing 6 activities).

## Variable Description ##

In the previous section, two devices were briefly covered (an accelerometer and a gyroscope) that were used to generate sensor signals for 6 activities performed by participants. Since our data set has been derived from sensor signals produced by these devices, it is appropriate to discuss our data variables in context of the two devices.
