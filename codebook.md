## Data set Description ##

The Human Activity Recognition data set was generated as a result of an experiment involving 30 participants (labelled in the data set as *Subjects*), each performing the following 6 activities:
- Walking
- Walking Upstairs
- Walking Downstairs
- Sitting
- Standing
- Laying

As the participants performed the aforementioned activities, a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) tied to the waist of each participant recorded sensor signals for various metrics, using its embedded [Accelerometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer) and [Gyroscope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope). An accelerometer is an inertial sensor that measures acceleration by making use of an Inertial or Fictitious force; A gyroscope is a mechanical device that measures orientation and angular velocity, using Earth's gravity. When combined, accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used for a more accurate recognition of movement. Also, accelerometers and gyroscopes can take measurements over 1, 2, or 3 axes, depending upon requirements. 
In the current data set, such measurements have been recorded over 3 axes, and in total, the data set contains 88 variables/columns over 180 records (30 Subjects performing 6 activities).
